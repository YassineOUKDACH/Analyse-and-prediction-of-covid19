### Simulating small populations during an epidemic and monitoring SIR
![Python application](https://github.com/rehanvipin/andromeda/workflows/Python%20application/badge.svg)

A simulation model in python, inspired by the 3blue1brown video: [Simulating an epidemic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs&t=1s)  

Andromeda is desktop GUI app, that lets you explore the effects on various parameters affecting the spread and the deadliness of a epidemic. With the goals of being a web app that increases awareness among people about effects of behavioural changes on stopping the spread of an epidemic. Made during the outbreak of COVID-19, we hope people can understand how these viruses spread.
